/**
 * Integration Test: Validation Failure Handling
 *
 * Purpose: Test fail-fast validation behavior where any validation rule failure
 * results in complete transaction rejection. Critical for maintaining financial
 * data integrity and preventing partial/corrupted transaction records.
 *
 * This test MUST FAIL until implementation is provided.
