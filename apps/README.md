# Apps

This directory contains application packages for the monorepo.

Each subdirectory should be a standalone application with its own package.json.

Example structure:
```
apps/
├── cli/           # Command-line interface application
├── web/           # Web interface (if needed)
└── api/           # API server (if needed)
```
